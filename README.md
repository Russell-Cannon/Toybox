Quilt for shaders. Derivative but deeper AND wider

Distance fields for basic shapes: line, circle, rectangle, square(rectangle named alternative), screen (named rectangle alternative), triangle

Linear mathematical operations: divide, add, subtract, modulus, floor, ceil, round, negate
-support these by symbol (stretch)

//Trig operations: sin, cos, tan

GL operations: lerp, mix, step, smooth step, clamp

Vector math operations: dot, cross, normalize, length, distance, direction 

A default texture just named texture 
Other textures can specified in the variables section by referencing a file path

Average function which can take any number of children (1- infinity)

Shorthand for useful functions: sobel, gaussian, noise, 

Swizzling
-impossible?
-Could make a function which returns the vector times 0 in all but the axis desired

Example projects:
CRT filter
Roal Dalh filter
Mandelbrot set

Also: 
some way to record or screenshot the page in browser (stretch)
