Quilt for shaders. Derivative but deeper AND wider

# To Do

- [x] Display name of operations in syntax error
- [ ] Vector math
- [ ] Distance fields
  - [ ] Line
  - [x] Screen
  - [ ] Circle
  - [x] Regular Polygons
- [-] Map of AST
- [ ] Useful shorthands
  - [ ] Sobel
  - [ ] Gaussian blur
  - [ ] White noise
- [ ] Example projects
- [x] Comment support
- [ ] External textures
  - [ ] REGEX for file path

Distance fields for basic shapes: line, circle, rectangle, square(rectangle named alternative), screen (named rectangle alternative), triangle

/Linear mathematical operations: divide, add, subtract, modulus, floor, ceil, round, negate
/support these by symbol (stretch)

/Trig operations: sin, cos, tan

/GL operations: lerp, mix, smooth step, step, clamp

Vector math operations: dot, cross, normalize, length, distance, direction

/A default texture just named texture
Other textures can specified in the variables section by referencing a file path

/Average function which can take any number of children

Shorthand for useful functions: sobel, gaussian, noise,

/Swizzling
/Make a 'combine' function which takes a parameter for each axis

Draw a map of the tree like in Quilt

Example projects:
CRT filter
Roal Dalh filter
Mandelbrot set
Waving flag

Also:
some way to record or screenshot the page in browser (stretch)
